# DOM-Calculator

## Description about the Task

  + This is my `Mini Calculator`, a task centered around DOM manipulation.
  + The result is displayed by creating an input tag in `HTML` and styling it with a `stylesheet`.
  + Within the DOM, a variable is stored, and its value is retrieved using **getElementById**.
  + Number and symbol buttons are displayed using **functions**.
  + In the equal button, the **calculate()** function employs a `try-catch` method to `evaluate operations`.
  + The try statement defines **a block of code to test for errors during execution,while the catch statement defines a block of code to execute if an error occurs in the try block**
  + The `clear()` function is used to reset input values.
  + Additionally, the `delete()` function deletes values one by one using the **slice method**.
